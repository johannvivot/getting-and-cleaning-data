# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The course project developed in the end of the 4th week of the Getting and Cleaning Data course.
The run_analysis.R does the following:

1. Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
6. From the data set in step 5, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The script will result in the `tidy.txt`.
